# Welcome to "SoundScape"!

This is the fourth course in the Alura series, focused on advanced development in C# and building an application inspired by music streaming services like Spotify.

## Overview

"SoundScape" is a music application designed to provide users with an immersive and personalized listening experience. Developed with C# and based on advanced object-oriented programming concepts, the project represents an evolution from our previous work, "Screen-Sound".

## What's New and Improved

1. **API Consumption:** We've implemented a robust system for consuming data from an external API, allowing integration of new features and access to a vast catalog of music.

2. **File Recording:** We've added the ability to record audio files locally, giving users the option to save their favorite songs for offline listening.

3. **Utilization of LINQ:** We've leveraged the power of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to perform advanced queries and operations on application data, providing a more fluid and intuitive user experience.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have the C# development environment set up on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local environment.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE, such as Visual Studio.
4. Compile and run the main program, Program.cs.

Enjoy the personalized musical experience offered by "SoundScape" and explore all its advanced features!
